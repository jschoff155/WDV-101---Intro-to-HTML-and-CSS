            <h3>The Rains of Castemere - Game of Thrones soundtrack</h3>
            <p>And who are you, the proud lord said
                That I must bow so low?
                Only a cat of a different coat
                That's all the truth I know
                In a coat of gold or a coat of red
                A lion still has claws
                And mine are long and sharp, my lord
                As long and sharp as yours
                And so he spoke, and so he spoke
                That lord of Castamere
                But now the rains weep o'er his hall
                With no one there to hear
                Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall
                And not a soul to hear
                And so he spoke, and so he spoke
                That lord of Castamere
                But now the rains weep o'er his hall
                With no one there to hear
                Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall
                And not a soul to hear</p>

                So you got to dodge 'im and you got to duck 'im
                You got to keep that diesel truckin'
                Just put that hammer down and give it hell
                East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
                A-we gonna do what they say can't be done
                We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there

            <h3>Fancy - Reba</h3>
            <p>I remember it all very well lookin' back
                It was the summer I turned eighteen
                We lived in a one-room, run-down shack
                On the outskirts of New Orleans
                We didn't have money for food or rent
                To say the least we were hard-pressed
                Then mama spent every last penny we had
                To buy me a dancin' dress
                Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
                And she painted my eyes and lips
                Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
                That had a split on the side clean up to my hips
                It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
                Standin' back from the lookin' glass
                There stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood
                She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
                Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
                Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck, then she kissed my cheek
                And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes when she started to speak
                She looked at her pitiful shack
                And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
                She said, "Your pa's runned off, I'm real sick
                And the baby's gonna starve to death"
                She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
                "To thine own self be true."
                And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
                The toe of my high-heeled shoe
                It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
                Askin', "Mama, what do I do?"
                She said, "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
                And they'll be nice to you."
                She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
                Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
                Lord, forgive me for what I do
                But if you want out, well, it's up to you
                Now don't let me down
                Now your mama's gonna move you uptown"
                Well, that was the last time I saw my ma
                The night I left that rickety shack
                The welfare people came and took the baby
                Mama died and I ain't been back
                But the wheels of fate had started to turn
                And for me there was no way out
                It wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
                What my mama'd been talkin' about
                I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
                That I's gonna be a lady someday
                Though I didn't know when or how
                But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
                With my head hung down in shame
                You know I might have been born just plain white trash
                But Fancy was my name
                She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
                She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
                It wasn't long after that benevolent man took me in off the street
                And one week later I was pourin' his tea in a five-room hotel suite (yes, she was)
                I charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat
                And then I got me a Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat
                And I ain't done bad (she ain't been bad)
                Now in this world, there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
                That would call me bad
                They criticize my mama for turning me out
                No matter how little we had
                But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for now on fifteen years
                Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor mama's voice ringin' in my ears
                "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
                She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
                Lord, forgive me for what I do
                But if you want out, well, it's up to you
                Now don't let me down
                Now your Mama's gonna move you uptown"</p>
